Guide: Setting up the Fraud Detection Backend

This guide details the steps required to get the Flask API, Redis, and GeoIP components running on your local machine after cloning the project from GitHub.

1. Prerequisites (What You Need)

Ensure these three components are installed and accessible on your machine:

Python 3 (version 3.8 or newer recommended).

Git (for cloning the repository).

Redis Server: The Redis database server must be installed and running locally on its default port (6379).

2. Setup Procedure

Step A: Clone and Navigate

Open your terminal or command prompt (PowerShell or Bash):

# Clone the repository (replace [your_repo_url] with the actual GitHub URL)
git clone [your_repo_url]

# Move into the project directory
cd T13-Fraud_Detection


Step B: Install Python Dependencies

Run this single command. It reads the requirements.txt file and installs the exact versions of Flask, Redis, and GeoIP that the backend was developed with:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Step C: Verify Redis is Running

Ensure the Redis server is actively running in the background. If it's not running, your API will fail to start.

Step D: Run the Backend API

Start the main application script:

python fraud_detection_api.py


3. Verification and API Details

Success Confirmation

Your API is ready when you see these specific status messages in your terminal:

STATUS: Successfully connected to Redis.

STATUS: Successfully loaded GeoIP database from GeoLite2-City.mmdb

* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
